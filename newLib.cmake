# new_project_library searches for source files in PATH and generates a CMakeLists.txt.
# The (optional) CMakeScript.cmake in PATH will be executed first
#
# Usage:
# new_project_library
#    NAME         <Name of the library>
#    PATH         <path to the source dir>
#    TEMPLATE     <path to the CMake template file>
#    DEPENDENCIES <dependencies (optional)>
#    EXCLUDE      <list of regex to exclude (optional)>
#    EXT_CPP      <list of valid c++ extensions (optinal [default: cpp;cxx;C;c])
#    EXT_HPP      <list of valid c++ extensions (optinal [default: hpp;hxx;H;h])
#
# Variables available in the template:
#    CM_CURRENT_SRC_CPP
#    CM_CURRENT_SRC_HPP
#    CM_CURRENT_LIB_SRC
#    CM_CURRENT_LIB_INC
#    CM_CURRENT_LIB_LC
#    CM_CURRENT_LIB_UC
#    CURRENT_INCLUDE_DIRS
#
# Exported variables (multiple calls to new_project_library will extend these lists)
#    ${PROJECT_NAME}_LIB_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES  <List of all directories>
#    ${PROJECT_NAME}_SUBDIR_LIST              <List of all generated subdirectories>
#    ${PROJECT_NAME}_ALL_UNASIGNED_<H,C>PP    <List of ALL source files (has a CPP and HPP version)>
#    ${PROJECT_NAME}_ALL_SRC_${I}_<H,C>PP     <List of source files for platform target ${I} (has a CPP and HPP version)>
#    ${PROJECT_NAME}_ALL_SRC_ALL_<H,C>PP      <List of source files for all platform targets (has a CPP and HPP version)>
